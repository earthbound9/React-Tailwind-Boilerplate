# React Tailwind Boilerplate

This boilerplate is using the newest versions of babel and webpack.

as well as postcss and purgecss so you wont have to worry about css file size

This package is also using styled components  
and is fully integrated with it so theres no need  
to use external style sheets.

One of the main benefits is being able to make component classes  
on the fly like so.

```js
const StyledButton = styled.button`
  ${tw('bg-blue text-white px-8 py-4')};
`;
```
